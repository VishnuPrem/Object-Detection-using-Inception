# Object-Detection-using-Inception

Inception v3 is a pretrained deep neural network trained by Google to identify 1000 distinct classes of images.
Recognizer3 is a java program that loads the inception model and labels to classify images which are loaded. The program is based heavily on: https://github.com/emara-geek/object-recognition-tensorflow.
Changes were made to make it more applicable for robotics applications
